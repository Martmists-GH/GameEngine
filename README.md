# Game Engine

This is a game engine written in Kotlin using LWJGL.

### Why?

KorGE dropped 3D support and GDX is a nightmare, and I wanted something easier to use, so this was made.

### How do I use it?

Check the [sample snippet](./src/test/kotlin/sample.kt) for a short example. At some point I might make this a multi-module repo with an examples subproject.
